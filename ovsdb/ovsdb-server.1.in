.SH NAME
ovsdb\-server \- Open vSwitch database server
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBovsdb\-server\fR
\fIdatabase\fR
[\fB--remote=\fIremote\fR]\&...
[\fB--run=\fIcommand\fR]
.so lib/daemon-syn.man
.so lib/vlog-syn.man
.so lib/common-syn.man
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovsdb\-server\fR program provides RPC interfaces to an Open
vSwitch database (OVSDB).  It supports JSON-RPC client connections
over active or passive TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets.
.PP
The name of the OVSDB file must be specified on the command line as
\fIdatabase\fR, which must already have been created and initialized
using, for example, \fBovsdb\-tool create\fR.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "\fB\-\-remote=\fIremote\fR"
Adds \fIremote\fR as a connection method used by \fBovsdb\-server\fR.
\fIremote\fR must take one of the following forms:
.
.RS
.so ovsdb/remote-passive.man
.so ovsdb/remote-active.man
.
.IP "\fBdb:\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR"
Reads additional connection methods from \fIcolumn\fR in all of the
rows in \fItable\fR within the \fBovsdb\-server\fR database.  The
\fIcolumn\fR must have type string or set of strings.  The connection
methods in the column must have one of the forms described above.  As
the contents of \fIcolumn\fR changes, \fBovsdb\-server\fR also adds
and drops connection methods accordingly.
.RE
.
.IP "\fB\-\-run=\fIcommand\fR]"
Ordinarily \fBovsdb\-server\fR runs forever, or until it is told to
exit (see \fBRUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\fR below).  With this option,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR instead starts a shell subprocess running
\fIcommand\fR.  When the subprocess terminates, \fBovsdb\-server\fR
also exits gracefully.  If the subprocess exits normally with exit
code 0, then \fBovsdb\-server\fR exits with exit code 0 also;
otherwise, it exits with exit code 1.
.IP
This option can be useful where a database server is needed only to
run a single command, e.g.:
.B "ovsdb-server --remote=punix:socket --run='ovsdb-client dump unix:socket Open_vSwitch'"

These commands are specific to \fBovsdb\-server\fR.
.IP "\fBexit\fR"
Causes \fBovsdb\-server\fR to gracefully terminate.

Compacts the database in-place.  The database is also automatically
compacted occasionally.
