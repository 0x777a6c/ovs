# VSWITCH_BASE: Root directory where vswitch binaries are installed
# VSWITCH_BASE=/root/vswitch/openvswitch/build

# ENABLE_BRCOMPAT: If 'y' than emulate linux bridging interfaces
#    using the brcompat kernel module and ovs-brcompatd daemon
# ENABLE_BRCOMPAT=y

# ENABLE_FAKE_PROC_NET: If 'y' then emulate linux bonding and vlan
#    files in /proc as if the bonding and vlan demultiplexing done in
#    ovs-vswitchd were being implemented using existing Linux mechanisms.
#    This is useful in some cases when replacing existing solutions.
# ENABLE_FAKE_PROC_NET=y

# FORCE_COREFILES: If 'y' then core files will be enabled.
# FORCE_COREFILES=y

# COREFILE_PATTERN: Pattern used to determine path and filename for
#     core files when FORCE_COREFILES is 'y'.  This is Linux specific.
#     See the manpage for "core".
# COREFILE_PATTERN="/var/log/%e-%t"

# VSWITCHD_CONF: File in which ovs-vswitchd stores its configuration.
# VSWITCHD_CONF=/etc/ovs-vswitchd.conf

# VSWITCHD_PIDFILE: File in which to store the pid of the running
#     ovs-vswitchd.
# VSWITCHD_PIDFILE=/var/run/ovs-vswitchd.pid

# VSWITCHD_RUN_DIR: Set the directory in which ovs-vswitchd should be
#     run.  This mainly affects where core files will be placed.
# VSWITCHD_RUN_DIR=/var/xen/vswitch

# VSWITCHD_PRIORITY: "nice" priority at which to run ovs-vswitchd and related
#     processes.
# VSWITCHD_PRIORITY=-5

# VSWITCHD_NETBACK_PRIORITY: "nice" priority at which to run netback.
#     It is a good idea to run ovs-vswitchd at a higher priority than
#     netback to ensure that it gets enough CPU time to set up flows
#     (bug #1656).  Set this to 'default' to avoid changing netback's
#     priority.
# VSWITCHD_NETBACK_PRIORITY=0

# VSWITCHD_LOGFILE: File to send the FILE_LOGLEVEL log messages to.
# VSWITCHD_LOGFILE=/var/log/ovs-vswitchd.log

# VSWITCHD_FILE_LOGLEVEL: Log level at which to log into the
#     VSWITCHD_LOG file.  If this is null or not set the logfile will
#     not be created and nothing will be sent to it.  This is the
#     default.  The available options are: EMER, WARN, INFO and DBG.
# VSWITCHD_FILE_LOGLEVEL=""

# VSWITCHD_SYSLOG_LOGLEVEL: Log level at which to log into syslog.  If
#     this is null or not set the default is to log to syslog
#     emergency and warning level messages only.
# VSWITCHD_SYSLOG_LOGLEVEL="WARN"

# BRCOMPATD_PIDFILE: File in which to store the pid of the running
#     ovs-brcompatd (the Linux bridge compatibility daemon for ovs-vswitchd).
#     If this is the empty string, ovs-brcompatd will not be started and
#     the brcompat_mod kernel module will not be inserted.  Note that
#     the default is to use brcompat!
# BRCOMPATD_PIDFILE=/var/run/ovs-brcompatd.pid

# BRCOMPATD_RUN_DIR: Set the directory in which ovs-brcompatd should be
#     run.  This mainly affects where core files will be placed.
# BRCOMPATD_RUN_DIR=/var/xen/vswitch

# BRCOMPATD_PRIORITY: "nice" priority at which to run ovs-vswitchd and related
#     processes.
# BRCOMPATD_PRIORITY=-5

# BRCOMPATD_LOGFILE: File to send the FILE_LOGLEVEL log messages to.
# BRCOMPATD_LOGFILE=/var/log/ovs-brcompatd.log

# BRCOMPATD_FILE_LOGLEVEL: Log level at which to log into the
#     BRCOMPATD_LOG file.  If this is null or not set the logfile will
#     not be created and nothing will be sent to it.  This is the
#     default.  The available options are: EMER, WARN, INFO and DBG.
# BRCOMPATD_FILE_LOGLEVEL=""

# BRCOMPATD_SYSLOG_LOGLEVEL: Log level at which to log into syslog.  If
#     this is null or not set the default is to log to syslog
#     emergency and warning level messages only.
# BRCOMPATD_SYSLOG_LOGLEVEL="WARN"
